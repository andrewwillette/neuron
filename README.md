# neuron

A single neuron from a neural network.

Given a set of arrays and their corresponding return values, this script will assign a "weight" for each input. The greater the weight, the greater the effect on the neuron's output. This process of repeatedly making assumptions on a system and checking the error of that assumption is called backward propagation.
